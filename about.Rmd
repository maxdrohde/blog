Hello, Iâ€™m Max. I have a BA in Physics and Geology from Carleton College in Northfield, MN and I'm currently a Biostatistics graduate student at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN.

Before coming to Vanderbilt, I worked as an ORISE Fellow at the FDA Division of Antiviral Products in the Office of New Drugs, where I analyzed clinical trials for hepatitis and HIV medications. My interests are in adaptive clinical trial design, reproducible research, and statistics education.

In my free time I enjoy cooking (and collecting cookbooks), playing funk guitar, and swimming.
