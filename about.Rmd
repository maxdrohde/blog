<p style="font-family: Lato; font-size:20px;">Hello, I’m Max. I have a BA in Physics and Geology from [Carleton College](https://www.carleton.edu) and I'm currently a graduate student at Vanderbilt University in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.vumc.org/biostatistics/chair).</p>

## About me
I worked as an ORISE Fellow from 2018-2020 in the [FDA Division of Antivirals](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/center-drug-evaluation-and-research-cder/office-infectious-diseases-oid) (Office of New Drugs), where I built natural-language processing tools for product label data, and conducted meta-analyses of clinical trials for [hepatitis C](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2020.08.042) and [HIV](https://www.croiconference.org/abstract/investigation-of-a-potential-composite-endpoint-for-immunologic-nonresponder-trials/) treatments. My interests are in adaptive clinical trial design, reproducible research, and statistics education.

In addition to my work at the FDA, I have conducted research with the LIGO collaboration on the effects of [magnetic transients on gravitational wave detection](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6382/aa60eb), studied the effects of [atmospheric noise on seismometers](https://doi.org/10.1785/0220160193) at the Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory, and worked in science policy at the [MIT Washington Office](https://dc.mit.edu) in Washington, DC.

Communicating science is as important as research to me. The past few years I have been working as a [tutor](https://prep1on1.com/our-team/), where I love teaching high-school and undergraduate students physics, chemistry, and mathematics.

In my free time I enjoy cooking (and collecting cookbooks), playing funk guitar, and swimming.
