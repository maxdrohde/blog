I have a BA in Physics and Geology from Carleton College in Northfield, MN and I’m currently a Biostatistics graduate student at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN. Before coming to Vanderbilt, I worked as an ORISE Fellow at the FDA Division of Antiviral Products in the Office of New Drugs, where I analyzed clinical trials for hepatitis and HIV medications. My interests are in adaptive clinical trial design, reproducible research, and statistics education.\nIn my free time I enjoy cooking (and collecting cookbooks), playing funk guitar, and swimming.\nYou can find my publications at my Google scholar page here.\n\n\n\n",
