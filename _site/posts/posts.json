These values are called statistics. Common example include the mean, median, and the mode as statistics that represent measures of the center of the data.\nOther examples include the maximum observation in the data, the minimum, or the 3rd observation in the data, when the data are arranged from largest to smallest. These are called order statistics.\n\nFor example, the 3rd order statistic is written \\(X_{(3)}\\), where \\(X\\) is a random vector denoting our sample.\nWe can even create arbitrary statistics that appear to have little use, such as adding the first and third elements of the data and dividing by 17.\n\\[\n\\text{Weird Statistic} = \\frac{x_1 + x_3}{17}\n\\]\nSimulating statistics of dice rolls\nAs a simple data-generating process, letâ€™s consider rolling 5 dice. Each time we roll, we obtain 5 numbers, each from 1 to 6. We will call each one of these vectors of 5 numbers, \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\), a sample.\n\n\n# A function to roll `n` dice\nroll <- function(n){\n  sample(x = 1:6, size=n, replace=TRUE)\n}\n\n# Returns the nth order statistic of the sample\norder_stat <- function(x, n){\n  x <- sort(x)\n  return(x[n])\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n# Roll 5 dice 100,000 times\ndata <- map(1:1e5, ~roll(5))\n\n# Look at first three rolls\ndata[1:3]\n\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 2 2 2 3 3\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 2 3 3 6 1\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 6 3 6 6 2\n\n\n\n# Generate various statistics for each roll\nmedians <- map_dbl(data, ~median(.x))\nmeans <- map_dbl(data, ~mean(.x))\nminimums <- map_dbl(data, ~min(.x))\nmaximums <- map_dbl(data, ~max(.x))\nsecond_order_stat <- map_dbl(data, ~order_stat(x=.x, n=2))\nranges <- maximums - minimums\n\n\n\n\n\ndf <- tibble(medians, means, minimums, maximums, second_order_stat, ranges)\n\ndf <- pivot_longer(df, cols = everything())\n\n\n\n\n\ndf$name <- recode(df$name,\n  `medians` = \"Median\",\n  `means` = \"Mean\",\n  `minimums` = \"Minimum\",\n  `maximums` = \"Maximum\",\n  `second_order_stat` = \"2nd Order Statistic\",\n  `ranges` = \"Range\")\n\ndf$name <- as.factor(df$name)\ndf$name <- fct_relevel(df$name,\n                       c(\"Minimum\",\n                         \"2nd Order Statistic\",\n                         \"Maximum\",\n                         \"Range\",\n                         \"Mean\",\n                         \"Median\"))\n\ndf %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = value)) +\n  geom_bar(aes(y = ..prop..),\n           width = 0.2, fill = \"gray\", color = \"black\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:6) +\n  facet_wrap(~name, scales = \"free_x\") +\n  labs(x = \"Value\",\n       y = \"Estimated Probability\",\n       title = \"Distribution of various statistics for 100,000 rolls of 5 dice\",\n       caption = \"Monte Carlo estimate with 100,000 simulations\") +\n  ggthemes::theme_solarized() +\n  theme(text = element_text(size = 12, family = \"Source Sans Pro\"))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Various order statistics for rolls of 5 standard dice.
